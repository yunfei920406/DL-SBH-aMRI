## üß¨ Overview

This is the official implementation of  **Deep Learning‚ÄìEnabled Single Breath-Hold Abbreviated MRI (DL-SBH-aMRI)** protocol for HCC diagnosis.

**Objective:** The goal is to develop a Deep Learning‚ÄìEnabled Single Breath-Hold Abbreviated MRI (DL-SBH-aMRI) protocol for HCC diagnosis.

**Conclusion:** DL-SBH-aMRI enables gadolinium-free, ultra-fast imaging within a single breath-hold, while preserving full-sequence diagnostic information and achieving performance comparable to conventional MRI, representing a promising and cost-effective alternative for HCC diagnosis.

## üñº Representative Results

The figure below presents representative **comparisons between DL-SBH-aMRI and complete full-sequence MRI (cMRI)** across four common hepatic lesion types.

### üîç Description

- Each panel (**A‚ÄìD**) shows:
  - **Top row**: Ground-truth cMRI (all sequences acquired).
  - **Bottom row**: DL-SBH-aMRI results (only Pre-T1 acquired; others synthesized by **Li-DiffNet**).
- The same Pre-T1 image is used for alignment across sequences.
- **Lesion types**:
  - **A**: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  - **B**: Hepatic hemangioma
  - **C**: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
  - **D**: Hepatic cyst
- **Yellow arrows** mark lesion locations.
- All cases are from the **external validation cohort**.
