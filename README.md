# Official Implementation of Virtual Liver CE-MRI

This is the official implementation of the project: **Development and Validation of a Deep Learning-Enabled Single Breath-Hold Abbreviated MRI (DL-SBH-aMRI) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis: A Multicenter, Prospective, and Retrospective study**.

### Representative Cases of DL-SBH-aMRI and complete MRI

The following figure shows the representative comparisons between DL-SBH-aMRI and ground truth conventional complete MRI (cMRI) across diverse hepatic lesion types.

Panels **Aâ€“D** present side-by-side visual comparisons of cMRI (top rows, all sequences were acquired through MRI scanning) and DL-SBH-aMRI (bottom rows, comprising acquired Pre-T1 and synthetic sequences generated via Li-DiffNet) for four distinct hepatic lesion types: **(A)** HCC, **(B)** hepatic hemangioma, **(C)** intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and **(D)** hepatic cyst. In DL-SBH-aMRI, only the Pre-T1 is acquired through MRI scanning and all subsequent sequences are synthesized using the proposed Li-DiffNet. For direct visual comparison, the same Pre-T1 image from a single patient is repeatedly shown in each row of every panel. Yellow arrows indicate lesion locations. The four cases were all from the external validation group.
